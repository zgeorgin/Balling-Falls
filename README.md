# Balling-Falls
This is my project with simple physical ball simulation based on Verlet integration. For drawing I`m using my Drawing-Features library (that is currently based on SDL)

## That does it do?
For now it just can only drop balls on 2D-box, but I have big plans on it for future :)

## How to run it?
Just write this on project directory:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Balls
```

## Future
1. Make it work parallel for great optimization
2. Add support of complex boundaries (not just box)
3. Another secret feature ;)
